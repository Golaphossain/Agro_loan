# Agro_Loan
Only 25% out of 2 core 60 lac farmers accepts agriculture (Krishi) and Polli loan. A large portion of remaining 75% of farmers do not apply for a loan for the lack of adequate knowledge. And also Lack of proper information about documents and interest rates for loans. We proposed a solution to solve this problem.
## Features
-
- Organizations, farmers and other people who need loans required registration to apply for loans.
- Organization and customer profiles are created automatically when they complete their registration. User can update their profile.
- Organization posts their offer with proper instalment breakdowns including tax, interest, vat and other charges. They are allowed to edit and       delete their post.
- Customers can apply for selected loan offers. They can search by category for their specific loan. For application, they must fill up some important information. 
- Customers can compare the loan offer using the interest rate and duration of the loan. 
- Farmer can track the application through the applicant id.
