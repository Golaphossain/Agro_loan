# Agro_Loan
Only 25% out of 2 core 60 lac farmers accepts agriculture (Krishi) and Polli loan.A large portion of remaining 75% farmers does not apply for loan for the lack of adequate knowledge.And also Lack of proper information about document and interest rate for loan.We proposed a solution to solve this problem.
## Features

-Organization and customer profile created automatically when they complete their registration.User can update their profile.
-Organization posts their offer with proper installment breakdowns including tax, interest, vat and other charges. They are allowed to edit and delete their post.
-Customer can apply for selected loan offer. They can search by category for their specific loan. For application they must fill up some important information. 
-Customer can compare the loan offer using interest-rate and duration of loan. 
-Farmer can track the application through applicant id.
